It learns from the Rumpetroll. That one is written in ruby,\r\nbut this one is written in python and it supports Chinese.\r\n\r\nLicense: MIT (see LICENSE)\r\n\r\nInformation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1.git clone https://github.com/xsank/Pyrumpetroll.git\r\n\r\n2.pip install tornado\r\n\r\n3.then change the Settings.js's socketserver url to your local ip or your domain\r\n\r\n4.python main.py\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it works and seems like the http://rumpetroll.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nPreview\r\n-------\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsank/Pyrumpetroll/master/preview/preview.png \"Preview image\")\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI have tried to deploy the Pyrumpetroll on the SAE,but it seems that the cloud-service don't support the\r\nwebsocket. For example,i have to use SAE's channel to support long-connection,but it means the Pyrumpetroll\r\nhave to change a lot of code. So deploy the Pyrumpetroll on the vps our your personal server is the best and\r\neasiest way.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
